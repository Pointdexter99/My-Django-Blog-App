# My-Django-Blog-App
This is my first project made using django web framework integrated into firebase. The app has been deployed into blogdash-com.web.app , but the ntegration using python-firebase library is yet to be done.

The app can be seen working by downloading the project file and running the command "python manage.py runserver" on the command line inside the app's directory. The app is seen working on the local machine port 8000.
